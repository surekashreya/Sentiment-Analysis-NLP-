 # Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
## INTRODUCTION
Sentiment Analysis is one of the Natural Language Processing techniques, which can be used to determine the sensibility behind the texts, i.e. tweets, movie reviews, YouTube comments, any incoming message, etc.  It’s in use on a large scale as many big firms are using it to examine customer reviews about their product/services, on social media, their websites which helps them to maintain their brand values. Some of the big corporations using this technique to invigorate customer engagement with their service areas:
 
•	Trip Advisor
•	Google
•	Apple
•	KFC
 
Other application of sentiment analysis includes:
 
•	Twitter sentiment analysis,
•	IMDB movie ratings,
•	Amazon customer reviews,
•	YouTube videos comments

Current  YouTube  usage  statistics  indicate  the approximate scale of the site: at the time of this writing there  are  quite  1  billion  unique  users  viewing  video content,  watching  over  6  billion  hours  of  video  each month. Also, YouTube accounts for 20% of web traffic and 10% of total internet traffic. YouTube provides many social mechanisms to gauge user opinion and views a few videos by means of voting,  rating,  favourites,  sharing  and  negative comments,  etc.  It’s  important  to  notice that  YouTube provides  more  than  just  video  sharing


## ABOUT PROJECT
The Project is based on Natural language processing technique We  have  done sentimental  analysis  of  public  comments  by using python library called "NLTK", a platform for building python programs to work with Human language data.

Calculating the sentiment scores of positive, Negative, and neutral comments, analysing YouTube channels with 100% positive comments and 0% positive  comments and forming Wordcloud of most frequent , positive negative and neutral comments.
